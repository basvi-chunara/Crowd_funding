# Crowd_funding
##Overall summary
###This repository showcases an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline developed to process crowdfunding data using Python and Pandas. The project focuses on extracting data, transforming it through regular expressions and Python dictionary methods, and creating a PostgreSQL database schema for efficient data management. Four CSV files were generated, which were then utilized to design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and develop a table schema for the database.
